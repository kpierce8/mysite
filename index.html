		  <p>Welcome to my webpage. I am a post-doctoral researcher with the USDA 
	        Forest Service in the PNW Research Station located in Corvallis. <br/>
	      	My current research examines the spatial distribution of forest structure 
	        and wildland fuels in eastern Washington, western Oregon and the central 
	        Sierra Nevada using <a href="http://www.fsl.orst.edu/clams/gnn/">Gradient 
	        Nearest Neighbor</a> imputation. Forest management requires detailed spatial 
	        information over very large regions, however the resources do not exist 
	        to effectively sample such regions. Because of this, researchers and managers 
	        rely on sampling plus remote sensing from satellites to provide information 
	        that can't be obtained first hand. While this is often referred to as 
	        mapping it differs from traditonal mapping in that maps are usually drawn 
	        from know data or traced from photographs. Our forest structure &quot;maps&quot; 
	        are the results of statistical models. As such, much of my research deals 
	        with understanding the spatial accuracy of these models and trying to 
	        improve them. <br/>
	        My dissertation research examined woody regeneration patterns in montane 
	        systems at multiple scales. I am interested in how the physical template 
	        imposes limitations upon species distributions and how climatic changes 
	        might alter the physical template causing a shift in species patterns. 
	        My research also deals with the scale-specific phenomena of pattern detection 
          in nature and the abilitiy of sampling designs to capture them</p>
