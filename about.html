			<p>I currently work as a Landscape Ecologist/senior GIS analyst in the 
			science division of the habitat section of the Washington Dept. of Fish 
			&amp; Wildlife. My principle projects deal with high-resolution change detection,
			extracting stream gradient from DEM data, analyzing stream networks
			and assissting the Puget Sound Partnership with the land-use/land cover indicator of the dashboard.</p>
			<h2>USFS PNW Research Station</h2>
			<h3>Corvallis, OR.</h3>
			<p>From 2002-2007 I was a post-doctoral researcher with the USDA 
			Forest Service in the PNW Research Station located in Corvallis.
			<br />
			My research examined the spatial distribution of forest structure 
			and wildland fuels in eastern Washington, western Oregon and the central 
			Sierra Nevada using <a href="http://www.fsl.orst.edu/clams/gnn/">Gradient 
			Nearest Neighbor</a> imputation. Forest management requires detailed 
			spatial information over very large regions, however the resources do 
			not exist to effectively sample such regions. Because of this, researchers 
			and managers rely on sampling plus remote sensing from satellites to 
			provide information that can&#39;t be obtained first hand. While this is 
			often referred to as mapping it differs from traditonal mapping in that 
			maps are usually drawn from know data or traced from photographs. Our 
			forest structure &quot;maps&quot; are the results of statistical models. As such, 
			much of my research deals with understanding the spatial accuracy of 
			these models and trying to improve them. <br />

			<h2>Nicholas School of the Environment - Duke University</h2>
			<h3>Durham, NC</h3>
<p>
My dissertation research examined woody regeneration patterns in montane 
			systems at multiple scales. I am interested in how the physical template 
			imposes limitations upon species distributions and how climatic changes 
			might alter the physical template causing a shift in species patterns. 
			My research also deals with the scale-specific phenomena of pattern 
			detection in nature and the abilitiy of sampling designs to capture 
			them
