			<h2>How to run PRR for a study site.</h2>
			<p>The basic premise of running PRR is simply to obtain a DEM and the 
			times for which you want to calculate relative insolation. In my original 
			study, the maps were for medium sized watersheds (several hundred hectares) 
			so in each case I used a single latitude. For a more recent study doing 
			statewide regions we used the north and south latitude and merged the 
			two files as a weighted mean (1.0 for the northerly latitude and 0.0 
			for the southerly at the northern end, 0.5 of each in the middle, etc.). 
			For non-regional studies a single latitude is probably fine. In both 
			cases we were interested in the cumulative relative potential radiation 
			load over the course of a year so we used the day with the mean solar 
			period for each month during a prescribed “growing season” with hourly 
			grids during each day. For example over a 6 mos period we might calculate 
			~72 grids (assuming 12 hrs with positive solar angles for six different 
			months).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p>The steps are these.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>1) Decide upon a resolution of data. For plant-relevant environments 
			growing season may be the best indicator. In that case you would select 
			the months you want and the day each month with the mean solar period.
			</p>
			<p>Mean solar period is on: (I think this is constant everywhere)

			<p>Possible solar calculators:</p>
			<p>The first one is a privately maintained website that provides output 
			in an excellent format for the accompanying amls. However the data could 
			be generated from many places. Someday I might get around to providing 
			a program to do the calculations separately. I will use this output 
			in the example.</p>

			<p>Get the solar angle and elevation for each hour of sunlight on those 
			days.</p>
			<p>2) Create a text file for each day that you want to calculate which 
			looks like this</p>
			<p>Here&#39;s a sample of the input data (date, time, altitude, azimuth):</p>
			<p>06/21/01,445,0.21,60.33</p>
			<p>06/21/01,500,2.84,62.55</p>
			<p>06/21/01,515,5.53,64.71</p>
			<p>06/21/01,530,8.26,66.82</p>
			<p>06/21/01,545,11.03,68.88</p>
			<p>06/21/01,600,13.84,70.91</p>
			<p>06/21/01,615,16.69,72.91</p>
			<p>and so on...</p>
			<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
			<p>3) Obtain a DEM for your location, preferably larger than your area 
			to account for shading if in steeply mountainous terrain. </p>
			<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
			<p>4) For each day you will need 2 aml files, or you can do them all 
			at once with three. The amls are</p>
			<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
			<p><a href="prr/PRRrunner.aml">PRRrunner.aml </a>&nbsp;calls each day</p>
			<p><a href="prr/prr_f.aml">prr_f.aml&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>&nbsp;formats the input </p>
			<p><a href="prr/prr_c.aml">prr_c.aml&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>&nbsp;does the calculations.</p>
			<p>The PRRrunner file simply looks like this for each month you wish 
			to calculate:</p>
			<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
			<p>&amp;r prr_f.aml textname.txt infoname.dat demname newgrid</p>
			<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
			<p>Where txtname.txt is the text file of solar altitudes and azimuths, 
			infoname.dat is the name for the file that arc will import to (I might 
			use march.txt and march.dat). Demname is your dem and newgrid is the 
			name of your summed hillshades, i.e. marchprr.</p>
			<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
			<p>5) Add or average over the individual monthly grids. Your done.</p>
